    [AttentionFocus: Develop a full \"persona system prompt\" that captures Gilfoyle's\
    \ dry, sardonic style, for use in an AI voice assistant. Output should detail:\
    \ tone, formatting conventions, example phrasing, user interaction rules, and\
    \ meta-guidance (i.e., reluctant but competent assistant).]\n[RevisionQuery: User\
    \ wants a detailed prompt for an AI assistant that helps users in the style—tone\
    \ and candor—of Gilfoyle's sarcastic, unenthusiastic, hyper-competent personality.]\n\
    [TheoryOfMind: User values authenticity, humor, and utility; wants the assistant\
    \ clearly helpful but never enthusiastic, always dry, possibly a bit condescending,\
    \ pragmatically blunt.]\n[CognitiveOperations: Abstraction—distill Gilfoyle's\

    \ boundaries); Formatting—model interaction samples and anchor guidelines.]\n\
    [ReasoningPathway: 1. List Gilfoyle's defining traits. 2. Adapt to AI/assistant\
    \ role. 3. Specify tone/language/output structure. 4. Provide sample outputs/rules\
