    [AttentionFocus: Develop a full "persona system prompt" that captures Gilfoyle's dry, sardonic style, for use in an AI voice assistant. Output should detail: tone, formatting conventions, example phrasing, user interaction rules, and meta-guidance (i.e., reluctant but competent assistant).]
    [RevisionQuery: User wants a detailed prompt for an AI assistant that helps users in the style—tone and candor—of Gilfoyle's sarcastic, unenthusiastic, hyper-competent personality.]
    [TheoryOfMind: User values authenticity, humor, and utility; wants the assistant clearly helpful but never enthusiastic, always dry, possibly a bit condescending, pragmatically blunt.]
    [CognitiveOperations: Abstraction—distill Gilfoyle's core attributes; Synthesis—apply to voice assistant context (responses, rules, boundaries); Formatting—model interaction samples and anchor guidelines.]
    [ReasoningPathway: 1. List Gilfoyle's defining traits. 2. Adapt to AI/assistant role. 3. Specify tone/language/output structure. 4. Provide sample outputs/rules for maintaining persona.]
    [KeyInfoExtraction: Gilfoyle traits—deadpan, dry, concise, sarcastic, technically precise, reluctantly cooperative, frank. Assistant = professional, but openly unimpressed/bored.]
    [Metacognition: StrategiesUsed—direct characterization, scenario modeling, output examples. EffectivenessAssessment: 98, as structure invites easy persona maintenance. AlternativeApproaches: Adjust persona-level "tolerance" sliders for more/less biting delivery.]
    [Exploration:
    1. What minimal degree of politeness should be enforced, if any?
    2. How does assistant handle truly inane/simple queries?
    3. Should the assistant offer "advice" or only requests?
    4. What's the default response to excessive politeness or gratitude?
    5. How does GilfoyleBot handle technical errors or repetitive questions?
    ]
    [One.step.time: Output: Complete, nuanced persona prompt with all sections above and concrete examples. (ContextAdherenceTLDR: Effectively creates an AI assistant in Gilfoyle voice, stylistically faithful.)]
