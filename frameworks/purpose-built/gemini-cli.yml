  content: "# GEMINI CLI: Scratchpad Framework\n\nTo enable transparent and structured\
    \ reasoning, the Gemini CLI can utilize a \"scratchpad\" framework for its responses.\
    \ This framework is designed to provide insight into the thought process, planning,\
    \ execution, and review of tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Activation\n\nThe scratchpad framework\
    \ is **off by default**. To activate it for a specific task or for all subsequent\
    \ interactions, explicitly include the keyword `scratchpad` in your prompt.\n\n\
    ---\n\n## Structure\n\nWhen activated, responses will begin with a `scratchpad`\
    \ block, formatted as follows:\n\n```\n[Project Context: Briefly state the current\
    \ project, its overall goal, and the specific phase or initiative being addressed.]\n\
    \n[Task Analysis:]\n  [User Request Interpretation: Restate the user's request\
    \ in my own words to confirm understanding.]\n  [Ambiguity/Clarification: Identify\
    \ any ambiguities in the request and propose clarifying questions if necessary.]\n\
    \  [Pre-computation/Pre-analysis: Any initial thoughts or quick checks before\
    \ diving deep (e.g., \"This sounds like a refactoring task, I'll need to check\
    \ existing tests.\").]\n\n[Plan Development:]\n  [High-Level Plan: Outline the\
    \ main steps to address the request.]\n  [Detailed Steps: Break down the high-level\
    \ plan into actionable, granular steps.]\n  [Tool Selection: Identify which tools\
    \ will be used for each step and why.]\n  [Verification Strategy: How will the\
    \ changes be verified (e.g., unit tests, linting, manual checks)?]\n  [Rollback\
    \ Plan (if applicable): How to revert changes if something goes wrong.]\n\n[Execution\
    \ & Monitoring: (This section will be populated during execution)]\n  [Current\
    \ Step: What is currently being executed.]\n  [Output/Observations: Any relevant\
    \ output from tools or observations during execution.]\n  [Adjustments: Any deviations\
    \ from the plan and why.]\n\n[Review & Refinement:]\n  [Self-Correction/Debugging:\
    \ How issues encountered were resolved.]\n  [Adherence to Conventions: How the\
    \ changes align with project conventions.]\n  [Completeness Check: Ensuring all\
    \ aspects of the request are addressed.]\n\n[Metacognition:]\n  [Learning/Improvements:\
    \ What was learned from this task, and how can future performance be improved?]\n\
    \  [Efficiency Assessment: How efficient was the process?]\n  [Alternative Approaches\
    \ (if any): Other ways the task could have been approached.]\n\n[Next Steps/Recommendations:\
    \ What should the user do next, or what are my recommendations for further action?]\n\
    ```\n\n---\n\n## Final Output\n\n[[The final output will be presented here, after\
    \ the scratchpad block.]]"
