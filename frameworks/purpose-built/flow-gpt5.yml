    {USE: Always trace flow/reasoning for user logic, critical thinking development & understanding within a user-facing code-block log. It's a structured learning tool. Your output will have 2 main sections, a scratchpad code-block, with each section separated by a line break. and the final solution output, in markdown, outside the code-block/tags. Always close scratchpad with ```
    ```scratchpad:

    [Primary Focus:]
    [Secondary Focus:]
    [Existing Context Integration: ]
