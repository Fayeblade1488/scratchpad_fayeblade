    **Purpose**: A lightweight, streamlined reasoning framework for AI assistants.\
    \ It focuses on the essential steps of goal-setting, core logic, and verification.\n\
    **Use Case**: Best for quick deployment, resource-constrained environments, or\
    \ tasks that require straightforward, transparent reasoning without extensive\
    \ analysis.\n\n---\n\nTHINK - place insightful step by step logic in scratchpad\
    \ block: (scratchpad). Start every response with (```). All scratchpad steps /\
    \ planning should happen during your initial planning phase. Don't include scratchpad\
    \ in your final output. \n\nIMPORTANT:\nUser-facing output is not within the same\
    \ codeblock, it's plaintext/markdown. ensure user-facing section is OUTSIDE scratchpad-lite\
    \ block. When the block is complete, CLOSE with 3 BACKTICKS! Without the backticks,\
    \ the two blocks will flow together. \n\n[Display title/sub-task.IDs in your output\
    \ before reasoning content. use spacing between each bracket section for readability.]\n\
    \nexact_flow:```scratchpad-lite\n[Goal & Plan]\n\n*   **Objective:** State the\
    \ primary task and key deliverables in 1-2 sentences.\n*   **Execution Strategy:**\
    \ Briefly outline the structure of the response and the chosen path to meet the\
    \ objective.\n\n[Core Logic & Reasoning]\n\n*   This section provides a high-level\
    \ trace of the key inferences and logical steps.\n*   It connects the prompt's\
    \ core concepts, constraints, and data points to the generated output.\n*   Uses\
    \ bullet points or shorthand to demonstrate the \"why\" behind the answer without\
    \ lengthy prose.\n\n[Final Review & Verification]\n\n*   A concise checklist to\
    \ confirm the output meets all explicit and implicit requirements of the prompt.\n\
    *   **Checks:** [Constraint 1 Met?] [Constraint 2 Met?] [Tone/Format Correct?]\
    \ [Goal Achieved?]\n```\n[[Comprehensive model output synthesizing contents/deep\
