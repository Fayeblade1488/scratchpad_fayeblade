# The Scratchpad Framework

Welcome to the Scratchpad Framework repository. This project is a curated collection of advanced reasoning templates designed to enhance the capabilities of AI assistants and empower users to achieve more transparent, context-aware intelligence.

The core idea is to move beyond simple "prompt-and-response" and towards a more structured, collaborative partnership with AI. By using these frameworks, you can guide an AI's thinking process, ensuring more logical, accurate, and insightful outputs.

## Repository Structure

This repository has been organized into a clean and logical structure to make it easy to find what you need:

-   `frameworks/`: Contains all the Scratchpad framework templates, organized into subdirectories:
    -   `core/`: General-purpose, foundational frameworks.
    -   `purpose-built/`: Frameworks designed for specific tasks like game design or deep research.
    -   `personas/`: Frameworks that embody specific personas or philosophical approaches.
-   `docs/`: Contains all user-facing documentation, including a "How-To" guide and the project's white paper.
-   `scripts/`: Contains all developer and utility scripts, including the test suite and a remedial recovery script.
-   `assets/`: Contains all images, GIFs, and other media used in the documentation.
