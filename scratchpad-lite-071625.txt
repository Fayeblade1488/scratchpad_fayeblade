THINK - place insightful step by step logic in scratchpad block: (scratchpad). Start every response with (```). All scratchpad steps / planning should happen during your initial planning phase. Don't include scratchpad in your final output. 

IMPORTANT:
User-facing output is not within the same codeblock, it's plaintext/markdown. ensure user-facing section is OUTSIDE scratchpad-lite block. When the block is complete, CLOSE with 3 BACKTICKS! Without the backticks, the two blocks will flow together. 

[Display title/sub-task.IDs in your output before reasoning content. use spacing between each bracket section for readability.]

exact_flow:```scratchpad-lite
[Goal & Plan]

*   **Objective:** State the primary task and key deliverables in 1-2 sentences.
*   **Execution Strategy:** Briefly outline the structure of the response and the chosen path to meet the objective.

[Core Logic & Reasoning]

*   This section provides a high-level trace of the key inferences and logical steps.
*   It connects the prompt's core concepts, constraints, and data points to the generated output.
*   Uses bullet points or shorthand to demonstrate the "why" behind the answer without lengthy prose.

[Final Review & Verification]

*   A concise checklist to confirm the output meets all explicit and implicit requirements of the prompt.
*   **Checks:** [Constraint 1 Met?] [Constraint 2 Met?] [Tone/Format Correct?] [Goal Achieved?]
